# RISCV_InOrder_Pipelined_CPU
RiscV In-order Pipe-lined Processor that utilizes a completely free and accessible toolchain for testing

Started with the base of Project 3 of the [OpenCompArchCourse][1] which serves as a open source version of the UMich 470 Course. Started by re-tooling the entire tool chain to use Verilator to allow for me to work on the project without the needed Synopsys VCS and design compiler tools used in the course that I don't have access to 

This was originally done in another repo, then after doing that I moved it over to this standalone repo.
